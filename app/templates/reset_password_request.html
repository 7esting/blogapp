            Grab SECRET_KEY to pretect against against cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks 
            The form.hidden_tag() template argument generates a hidden field that includes a token
            that is used to protect the form against CSRF attacks. All you need to do to have the
            form protected is include this hidden field and have the SECRET_KEY variable defined in
            the Flask configuration. If you take care of these two things, Flask-WTF does the rest
            for you.
